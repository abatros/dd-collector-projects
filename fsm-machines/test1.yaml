  (1) Need to declare a name for each state.
  (2) for each state, "Enter" is the operation executed when entering the state. Can be undefined.
  (3) "Enter" is not same as Transition.
  (4) "Enter" will update the list of "enabled" actions/transitions for the new machine-state.
  (5) "Transition" is executed after the new state is established.
  (6) The transition executed must match (from-state, to-state) from the list of transitions.
  (7) Some states are a-stable: meaning they immediately jump to another state. Ex: "commited" is "astable"
